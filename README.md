# Rotary_Encoder_test

This example shows how to use a rotary encoder like the PEC11.

Turn the knob clockwise to decrease blinking rate, counterclockwise to increase.

* Maximum limit : 1 sec
* Minimum limit : 20 ms

## Fine tuning

Some encoders have detents and it can lead to instable results. This is why it it recommended to use *Half Resolution Mode* (see below). In this case, there will be 24 steps per 360Â° Rotation (PEC11R-xxxxx-x0024). Choose the stable edge by setting interrupts on RISING **or** FALLING edges.

This problem does not arise when using encoders without detents. You can even increase the resolution by setting interrupts on RISING **and** FALLING edges as shown in the following diagram *Full Resolution Mode* :


```
